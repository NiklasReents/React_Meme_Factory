## Description

This is a little fun project involving a meme API: one meme is rendered to the screen and you can switch through the memes fetched from the API on button click. In addition, meme texts can be added at the top and the bottom of an image; currently, the text alignment and image size need to be adjusted. future additions will involve a more "memetic" font and include more complex interactive options, such as downloading a meme image with the text added to it or allowing the user to upload an image etc.
